# Ion-Ramjet-Beta
 A physics simulation to model to effectiveness of a prosposed method of interstellar travel: ion ramjets. An ion ramjet uses the proven technology of ion thrusters in combination with the still sci-fi magnetic scoop to pick up fuel as it travels in the form of hydrogen from the insterstellar medium (ISM).
